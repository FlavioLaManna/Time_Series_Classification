# Time_Series_Classification
## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Politecnico di Milano 2022 - Second Homework

Wou were asked to correctly classify samples in the multivariate time series format. In other words, since this is a classification problem, the objective was to correctly map the information contained in the features calculated over time to their labels. We had two weeks to complete the homework and we were divided in groups of 3. The professors provided us the zipped dataset and we tested the models on a hidden test set on a platform called Codalab. The metric used to evaluate the models and to place the teams in the leadeboard was the total accuracy. Despite this, the main focus of the challenge was to gain confidence and experience with Neural Networks.\
We wrote a report to describe our developing process, the projectual choices, the solutions with which we came up and the results.\
We got 5/5 points.
